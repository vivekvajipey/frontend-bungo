# ü§ñ Bungo

> A philosophical game where humans prove their worth to AI, powered by World ID. Built by humans, for humans.

## üéØ The Concept

Bungo is an AI agent that challenges a fundamental premise of our AI future: what makes humans special? Players engage in intellectual discourse with Bungo, attempting to demonstrate uniquely human qualities. If they succeed in impressing Bungo with their humanity, they can win rewards from the collective pool.

### How it Works
1. Verify your humanity with World ID
2. Pay 0.1 USDC to challenge Bungo
3. Engage in conversation to prove human uniqueness
4. Top daily conversations win rewards from the pool
5. Winning conversations are anonymously showcased

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
